#### Note:

Unfortunately the project didn't come out exactly as intended due to lack of time. The final year project ended up taking up a lot more time than than expected this semester. However I'm happy with the end results as the animations look very cool.


## PROPOSAL STAGE

### Project Idea

My project is called **Disco Road**. The goal of this project is to create an audio visualizer experience in Unity that will allow the user to walk or move along a never ending road surrounded by moving music bars and other visual effects. This program will procedurally generate both a path for the player to walk on as well as other visual elements based on data from an audio track. 

As shown in the prototype image below, the user will be moving along an endless path that will move along with the song. The "road" is meant to replicate a [disco styled dancefloor](https://www.furniture4events.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Disco-LED-Dance-Floor-12.jpg). The user will be able to choose from two styles: black & white and rainbow. On both sides of the path there will be 3D walls made up of music bar cubes that will move along to the music. I am hoping to implement a feature that will allow the user to change the theme of the visual effects. A background made up of stars and a 3rd person view might also be implemented. For the 3rd person view, the user will be able to play as a cat character.

### Initial Prototype

The basic idea is to create something like this (although more visually appealing as this was made in paint.net):

In terms of the color scheme [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVYYMDDUgqY) is somthing I will be attempting to implement

### Research and Proposed Approach

I will began the development of this project by researching the implementation of audio visualizers in Unity with various Youtube tutorials and Unity tutorials.

I researched those following resources that help with getting started with audio visualization:
* https://forum.unity.com/threads/audio-visualization-tutorial-unity-c-q-a.432461/
* http://www.41post.com/4776/programming/unity-making-a-simple-audio-visualization

Next step will be implementing the never ending path the player will be moving along. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jdL5538bEo&list=PLLH3mUGkfFCXps_IYvtPcE9vcvqmGMpRK) YouTube video implements an "endless road" so I will looking into this resource to help with this part. After, I will work on ["dancing cubes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix3oa7nB2VA) which will be the sides of the path made up of music bars. Lastly I will be implementing any extra features I have listed below such as 3rd person view or a sky full of stars. To allow the user to take control of a cat character I will be looking for pre made models of cats that I could add into my program. From my research I've done so far I have not been able to find any free cat models I could use so I might end up attempting to animate my own simple cat model.

##### Possible features I'm hoping to implement if I have enough time:
* 3rd person view of a cute cat
* Ability to toggle between different stlyles/color schemes of visualisation.
* Sky full of starts in the background
